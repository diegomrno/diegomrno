Hello! I'm **Diego**, a passionate advocate for useful, relevant, and healthy technology. My mission is to make tech better, healthier, more secure, and more sustainable. I'm also the founder of [**Infinite**](https://github.com/infiniteHQ).

Most of my work focuses on finding solutions to make technology healthier and more beneficial, while actively combating harmful practices and negative aspects. You can check out the [manifesto](https://manifesto.infinite.si/) I follow for more details.
